    "In this notebook we will explore pathways on how to automate content production for Finn using Generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Status quo:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finn has currently high content production costs, as content is created externally.\n",
    "- To reduce costs, parts of the content production process could be automated.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can be automated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar repetitive content, e.g. certain blog posts, can be automated.\n",
    "- with a better pathway even more content can be automated, down the line\n",
    "\n",
    "Good to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- google values high quality content - this is independent of the content being generated by AI or not\n",
    "- AI is GOOD at creating informational content, which is the type of content that Finn is aiming to produce in this case\n",
